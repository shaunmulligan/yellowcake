Welcome to MarginalGainz. This a non-serious place where I write about cycling/triathlon and electronics. All of the projects and experiments here are in service to burning people on the bike lane and dropping the lads on the Sunday weekend warrior loop. 

Given my small bear physique and mediocre genetics I don't expect any of these projects to lead to Tour de France glory, so most of what you will find here is just stuff I find cool and interesting.
