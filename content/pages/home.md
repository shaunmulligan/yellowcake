The Endurance Engineer is a non-serious place where I write about cycling/triathlon and electronics. All of the projects and experiments here are in service to burning people on the bike lane and dropping the lads on the Sunday weekend warrior loop. 

Given my small bear-like physique and mediocre genetics, I don't expect any of these projects to lead to Tour de France glory or world titles. Most of what you will find here are things I find interesting and/or challenging. I hope to learn more about engineering, building products and my endurance abilities through the projects and experiments I build here :)
