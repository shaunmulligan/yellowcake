The Endurance Engineer is a non-serious place where I write about stuff like cycling, health, 3D printing, electronics and anything I find interesting. All of the projects and experiments here are to help me learn something about something or about myself. However, they are often also in the pursuit of burning people in the bike lane and dropping the lads on the Sunday loop ðŸ˜Ž

Given my small bear-like physique and mediocre genetics, I don't expect any of these projects to lead to Tour de France glory or world titles. Most of what you will find here are things I find interesting and/or challenging. I hope to learn more about engineering, building products and my endurance abilities through the projects and experiments I build here :)
