excerpt: The plan for 2021 is probably the biggest race year I have ever planned
  (assuming events happen). There is a race across the country, some triathlon
  and a few pure runs. I might even try my hand at a swim-run who knows :)

2021 is gearing up to be a doozy, assuming this insane global pandemic allows us to see other humans in the near future. The year as it stands is a smattering of triathlon, running, and a massive unsupported cycle race.

### Transpyrenees - 26th June

The first planned race for the year is the largest and possibly the most out of my wheelhouse. Having got super into cycling during the initial lockdown I perhaps overzealously registered to race the Transpyrenees ([transiberica.cc/transpyrenees](https://www.transiberica.cc/transpyrenees/))

The Transpyrenees is a multi-day race across the breadth of Spain. Starting from Llançà just north of Girona all the way to San Sebastián on the Atlantic coast. The race sticks to a predefined route measuring 1080km, which is not too bad. However, the route just happens to snake through the infamous Pyrenees mountains accumulating about 25000m of climbing along the way. 

One of the exciting bits of the race is that it is completely unsupported, so one has to find accommodation or a hedge to sleep in along the way. I have always wanted to give bike packing a bit of a go since I got started on two wheels. So a race across Spain with a time cap of 6 days was as good a place as any to give it a poke.

Since this is the first of my planned events and I'm a relatively inelegant climber, I plan to spend the entirity of the first half of 2021 hammering some cycling volume and dropping a few kgs so that I can thwart gravity while grinding up [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Tourmalet#Details_of_the_climb)[le Tourmalet](https://www.cyclingcols.com/col/Tourmalet).

### Ironman 70.3 Barcelona - 3rd October

Next up, we switch back into multi-sport mode with the goal of doing the [Barcelona half Ironman](https://www.ironman.com/im703-barcelona) at the beginning of October. This will be my first Ironman event (thems shits expensive). The course itself seems pretty chill, a quick dip in the Mediterranean sea covering 1.9km, followed up with an ultra-flat 90km bike along the seafront and then running donuts near the beach to finish out a half marathon. The graphic from the event website sums it up pretty accurately:

Coming off the massive amount of cycling in the first part of the year, I expect to focus mostly on the run and swim portions leading into October. I may even mainline some Ben & Jerry's to pick up a bit of dad bod buoyancy for the swim.

Depending on my run fitness, I should be able to get close to around 6 hours. At least that will be the goal!

### Barcelona Marathon - 7th November

Following up quickly on the heels of the 70.3 is the [E-dreams Barcelona Half Marathon](https://edreamsmitjabarcelona.com/idioma/en/) on the 17th of October. Not planning very much for this one and will mostly just cruise it as a training run for the full marathon. I did this race in 2019, took it easy, and ran 1h43. I think it should be easy to drop that a bit depending on what the fatigue is like after the Ironman 70.3.

The real kahuna running-wise for the year is the Barcelona Marathon on the 7th of November.

This will be my first full marathon, so not expecting to knock anyone's socks off. Hopefully, the running volume accumulated leading up to October will be feeling easy, and it should just be a matter of bumping it up a bit to make sure my legs feel good when I get past 30km. I have heard that one runs the first 10 miles of a marathon with excitement/adrenaline, the second 10 miles with your training, and the last 10 kilometers with your heart. So fully expecting to be destroyed coming into the finish line. The main goal will be to do it sub 4 hours. However, I think depending on how things go, I could perhaps sneak a 3h40 effort, especially if I get some of them new-fangled carbon blade runner shoes :)



### Others?

I fully expect 2021 to be almost as weird a year as 2020, so I plan to be pretty opportunistic about events and races where they happen. I would also love to find a swim-run race and possibly another cycle race. Something like a Gran Fondo or a cool gravel race would be ideal but haven't found the one yet.
