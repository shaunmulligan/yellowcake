Training for the first part of the year has gone extremely well. I've been feeling super strong and healthy. As mentioned in my ["Chasing 4 W/Kg"](https://enduranceengineer.com/posts/chasing-4-w-kg-part-i/) post, my FTP has been steadily climbing and my cycling VO2max (according to Garmin) has jumped from 56 to 66 ml/kg/min since December. I can only attribute these types of gains to doing proper structured training. I've been religously doing both 30/15s and 4x4min intervals at least once a week and then cruising mostly zone 2 stuff for the rest of the week. Its been super cool to see all that sweating paying off and finally feeling stronger on the climbs.

I think the other components that have been working well are rest and nutrition. Since the beginning of the year I have switched to a largely plant based diet, only occasionally eating fish. Its helped a ton with my weight lost program and also just made me feel way way better. Rest wise, I've also been strictly following the fitness vs. Fatigue graph on intervals.icu . I basically have just been trying to ensure my form doesn't dip too low and that my fitness stays above my fatigue line to ensure a good training stimulus. Below you can see the progression over the last 9 weeks since the beginning of the year.

Over the weekend, we did a biggish test day, as we are starting to ramp up the long days in preparation for the Transpyrenees. The route for sunday was a pretty flat drag out of Barcelona for 30km (18.6 mi) against the dumbest head wind. We then hooked a left up into the [Montseny National Park](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_natural_del_Montseny) which is home to some of the tallest peaks in the area. The main attraction for the ride was the accent up [Turo de l'Home](https://www.cyclingcols.com/col/TuroDeLHome), which is a lovely 27 km (16.7 mi) climb at about 5.5% topping out at 1527m (5042.6 ft) of elevation.

I must admit, I was pretty stressed going into this Sunday ride. It was by far my longest ride to date at 140km and included a non-negligible amount of climbing. However, l'Home is a good test of the kind of long range climbs waiting for me in the Pyrenees, so it was essential to give it a crack.

Overall the ride was spectacular, even though my Garmin headunit failed me right out of the gate, it spent the first 2 hours of the ride claiming to be 2% of the way through a route calculation. It was a good experience though as I had to just ride the lead up to the climb mostly on feel which I haven't done much since getting a power meter...

I felt super strong on the climb managing to push an average of 271 watts for an hour on the last 14km and feeling comfortable all the way through. After 5 hours out, 140km and 2000+ meters of climbing I still had legs and felt like I could push even further. So the test was a success and I am slowly starting to feel less worried about the looming beastly climbs of the Pyrenees. Over the next few weeks we will start building in even longer rides and hopefully try fit in an overnighter so that we can get used to pushing two big days back to back. Its gonna be sick!!
