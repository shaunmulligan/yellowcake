As mentioned in my [planned events post](https://enduranceengineer.com/posts/my-2021-events-schedule/), I have an everest load of mountains to cycle up in 2021. So the aim for the start of the year is to become mountain goat.

After reading a bunch, I came to the inescapable fact that I need to get stronger while simultaneously getting lighter. Basically I needed to improve my power to weight ratio drastically. The general consensus on reddit is that an FTP of **4W/kg** is pretty good for an amature cyclist, the equivalent of running a sub 3 hour marathon. So it seemed like a good target.

When I started cycling in July of 2019 garmin estimated my FTP at 277 and my first FTP test with a power meter in Jan. 2020 gave me an FTP of 233. At that time I weighed arount 84 kilos so we are looking at a power to weight ratio of about 2.77 W/kg starting 2020.

Looking at the progression of my FTP you can see a huge jump from March to April. This coincides with Spain going into heavy and me finding [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com) and picking up some of their structured training. So from that I definitely knew I could grow my FTP with a bit more structure, since most of my outdoor riding has been Sunday rides with the lads where we are the opposite of structured :)

The one thing I hadn't focused on at all until the start of this year was my weight. I've never been overweight but my smart scale definitely isn't overly kind about my BMI and body fat percentage. So since my power is already at a reasonable point, I feel weight is where I could make the biggest gains. Rolling into 2021 my weight was a beefy 84 Kgs which puts me closer to a ["very healthy" sprinter](https://www.yellowjersey.co.uk/the-draft/calculate-ideal-race-weight/) rather than a mountain goat. 

### The Huel Challenge/Fail: 

So on the 1st of Jan. I endevoured to fix my diet and drop a ton of weight. Since I haven't ever been a huge foody and hate prepping food, I tend to have quite a few [huel shakes](https://eu.huel.com). Since dropping weight is simply (Input - Output), I thought Huel would be a great tool to manage this. So the challenge was to live the month of Jan. on a diet of only Huel and Fruit. I was also miticulously counting the calories using [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com), making sure I kept up with calorie intake on bigger training days.

It all started out pretty well. My body is already pretty adapted to Huel, which is one of the main problem people cite when they have done a pure huel diet. I really enjoyed the simplicity of it, it was so easy to keep track of my intake and I didn't have to think at all about food. I was also feeling strong and well fed. The problems started on big training days. After one big day out riding I basically had MyFitnessPal suggesting I needed to eat about 4500 calories. So being the dilligent data nut that I am, I aspired to match that with Huel. Needless to say after guzzling that much Huel, I felt horrific. It was as if at some point in the day my stomach stopped being able to process the shakes, so I was just sat there feeling like a toffee flavoured snowglobe with Huel swirling around. \

Besides the negative impact on those big days, the Huel challenge also didn't gel well with the lady of the house. For some reason she actually loves feeding me food and it apparently gave her quite a bit of anxiety not being able to cook for me ( I know how lucky I am ). So unfortunately after two weeks I had to admit the Huel challenge was a failure and went back to chewing my food like the normals.

However, I am still doing 1 or 2 meals a day with Huel and pretty meticulously tracking my caloric intake and weight daily in this [OCD google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1410lZK8nlhsPa8UapOAuUHTwdL6FJicyPUx-zKDeyzk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Throwing in some Structure:

On top of the diet I have also started up with a bit more structure in my training since the start of the year. Currently I'm riding about 5 times a week. I have added in some indoor interval sessions, my current flavours of the week are:

[ODZwifters - 30/15's](https://whatsonzwift.com/workouts/zwift-fitness-ftp-challenge/vo2-max-odzwifters-3015s)

[ODZwifters - VO2max 445](https://whatsonzwift.com/workouts/zwift-fitness-ftp-challenge/vo2-max-odzwifters-vo2max-445)

Both of these are pretty tough and push me to spend a good amount of time above threshold. The rest of the week is basically zone 2 easy riding. However, its always hard to do my sunday group ride in zone 2, so that ends up being more of a tempo session or something like 2x20 at FTP.

What has been super interesting to see is that the above coupled with my dieting has already lead to a significant jump in FTP in just one month. I have gone from 284W to 302W which represents a 6.3% increase in raw power. While I have also dropped 4kgs in weight so we are currently sitting at a power to weight ratio of 3.82!

I think if I can carry on with the structure and push the weight down to a stable 75 those Pyrenees Mountains will eventually feel flat. At least thats the hope :)
